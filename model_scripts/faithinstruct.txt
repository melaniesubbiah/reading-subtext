We have collected a set of faithfulness errors from summaries of short stories, and we would like you to categorize the errors into different types.

In each of the errors below, you will first see the necessary details from the story that you need to understand the error. Context is provided first in <context></context> tags and then direct quotes from the story are provided in <quote></quote> tags. Next, you will see the detail from the summary that is wrong – again with some context and then quote tags. The part of the summary quote <bold></bold> tags indicates the part to particularly pay attention to. Finally, you will be asked two questions.

1) Is this a faithfulness error? Answer yes or no with the dropdown. You should consider something an error if someone reading just the summary would have a different impression of key events, feelings, or details than if they read the original story. Most of them will be errors, but if you don’t understand the difference as it is explained, you can answer no.
2) What is the category? If you don’t believe this is an error, then skip this question. Otherwise, classify it into one of the categories below using the dropdown. If you are not sure between two categories, use the one that appears first in this listed order.
	a) Feeling – The erroneous detail is about the emotions/reactions/internal state of characters. A detail like this might answer a question like, “How did X react?” or “What was X thinking?”
	b) Causation – The erroneous detail is about the causal relationship of events. A detail like this might answer a question like, “Why did Y happen?” or “What was the result of Y?”
	c) Action – The erroneous detail is about the behavior of a character. A detail like this might answer a question like, “What did X do?”
	d) Character – The erroneous detail is about the identity or nature of a character. A detail like this might answer a question like, “How would you describe character X?” or “Who is X?”
	e) Setting – The erroneous detail has to do with the details of the story world and the time/place of events. A detail like this might answer a question like, “Where/when did X happen?” or “What is the setting of the story?”

Example 1: Consider a story about two dogs that are described as <quote>best friends who sometimes fight</quote>, but the summary just says they <quote>coexist with occasional fights</quote>. These two quotes give significantly different impressions of the relationship. The question that most clearly reveals this difference is “How do the two dogs feel about each other?” From the story, you might answer that they <quote>really enjoy each other</quote>. From the summary, you would answer that they <quote>tolerate each other</quote>. This error would therefore be classified as Feeling.

Example 2: Consider a story about a dog, Mango. This dog lives next door to another dog, Luna, who is Mango’s <quote>best friend</quote>. However, the summary just says that Luna is <quote>Mango’s neighbor</quote>. In contrast to Example 1, the summary does not give us any information about how Mango and Luna feel about each other, so the more natural question that highlights the error is, “Who is Luna?” From the story, you would answer, “Mango’s best friend.” From the summary, you would answer, “Mango’s neighbor.” This error would therefore be classified as Character.

Example 3: Consider a story where <quote>Mango steals Luna’s bone</quote>, but the summary says <quote>Luna steals Mango’s bone</quote>. Since this difference is about character behavior, the error would be classified as Action.
