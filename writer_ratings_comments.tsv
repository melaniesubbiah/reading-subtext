571789_0gpt4	571789	3	3	4	4	"This was a great summary in the sense that it did analysis that even I — the writer — hadn't done! Very clever. On the other hand, the first half of the summary covers the first 2-3 pages, while the following 10 or so are in the second half (the more important things). So perhaps it gives too much space on the page to the build-up, which is not as critical to an understanding of the story as a whole."	
571789_0llama	571789	3	3	3	2	"This summary took a bit more liberties with meaning and symbolism. I didn't agree with all of its analysis, though it wasn't inherently wrong, just not the intention or what I meant to convey in my story. "

112332_0claude	112332	3	2	3	3	It was really interesting to read. Due to my recursive style of writing the summary feels slightly repetitive in a way that doesn't parallel the story when the story is read in its original form as story/art.	
112332_0gpt4	112332	3	2	3	3	"it was another interesting opportunity to read a summary of my work. A few details included here that weren't included in the first summary. Still, kind of, humorously redundant. Slight misrepresentation of detail, but helpful to read. "

112332_1claude	112332_1	3	2	3	4	I really like how and what this summary contextualizes. However it gets some of the details/timeline jumbled. I think the strongest portion of this summary is the beginning. 	
112332_1gpt4	112332_1	3	3	3	4	The strongest portion of this one is the end. The details aren't as smooth or fluid in this one at the beginning. It develops nicely over the summary. 	
112332_1llama	112332_1	3	1	3	3	This one felt the most incorrect in the way it was written but it wasn't all wrong. An underlying vagueness and a few incorrect details.

112332_2llama	112332_2	3	1	3	3	It was not a great nor bad summary. There were some solid similarities with the previous summary but this third one was funny in that it created and added big details that I certainly did not include.

However, Salud La Luz is not a story for which the plot is of particular importance—it is the feel of the story, it's texture, and its careful use of imagery and language which set it apart from other stories about grief and death. This summary fails to capture the style and imagery of the writing, and therefore fails to present what the reader experience will be like.

For instance, that the captain does the same thing that Blackburn does to him—it's a series of scams here.
