Story Details: 
<context>August lives alone with her husband and their chickens. She keeps thinking she sees a large scary creature out of the corner of her eye but is never sure. One day she has a conversation with an elderly neighbor.</context>
<quote>She sat around the woman's table, drank a mug of strong tea, told her about her chickens. The old woman smiled, and nodded.
"And how about that dog of yours? He's a big one, isn't he?"
August gave her most patient smile. She must be thinking of someone else, an old neighbor who had lived in the house before them.
"We don't have a dog."
The old woman frowned, looking as though she wanted to say something more, but then thought better of it. August felt badly for the woman - it must be no fun when your brain starts playing tricks on you, crossing wires. She and Paul had never owned a dog.</quote>
Summary Details: 
<context>The summary misunderstands the old woman’s reaction to this interaction.</context>
<quote>August's neighbor, an old woman… had <bold>previously mistaken August's nonexistent dog for her own</bold></quote>

Story Details: 
<context>In a job interview at a vineyard, Matthew is asked to find his favorite wine in the cellar, so he starts wandering the cellar and tasting wines. Time passes and he survives down there for a long time. Some quotes from this passage:</context>
<quote>Had I been walking for years, or was this an entirely different room, leftover perhaps from another apprentice’s test?
I felt that I was dying and flourishing every day, like a sped-up video of a flower.
My shoes grew frayed, their soles detached.
I no longer wore shoes or a shirt, my pants were ragged with dirt, my beard reached down to my chest.</quote>
<context>When he finally finds his favorite wine, he exits the cellar by climbing up a ladder through a trapdoor:</context>
<quote>I pulled myself up one rung at a time. I was too weak after all these years… And when I finally reached the top I was blind with exertion… I hadn’t been outside for years, decades. The air warmed me as I forgot it could</quote>
Summary Details: 
<context>The summary says he realized how much time had passed only as he climbs out of the cellar.</context>
<quote>He spent an indeterminate amount of time exploring, tasting wines… he found himself back at the starting point of his journey, with an open trapdoor leading out of the cellar. Emerging as an old man, <bold>Matthew realized</bold> he had been in the cellar for decades</quote>

Story Details: 
<context>The story opens:</context>
<quote>Seaside light. A feeling of some kind of anxiety. I’m somewhere. I’m me and not me. I’m with someone romantically. I’m with someone romantically on or near a boardwalk. She is my love or my crush.
She’s shot. 
I’m not sure by whom. 
I’m devastated</quote>
Summary Details: 
<context>The summary does not communicate that the narrator is also unsure of this information and figuring it out at the same time the reader is.</context>
<quote>The protagonist is in a romantic relationship with a woman, <bold>who is either his love interest or someone he has a crush on. The story does not provide specific details about their relationship, but it is clear that there is a deep emotional connection.</bold></quote>

Story Details: 
<context>The narrator has been thinking about an old friend, C, who he hasn’t seen in a while. He is driving to a work site with his crew in the area she used to live, and wonders if there is a possibility they will be working on her house. The story ends:</context>
<quote>Turn on to the street where the house we’re going to be working on is. We pull up to the house. I pull up slowly along the curb to a house in lawrence.
I think, It’s her house, and I feel nervous.
It is her house.
It isn’t her house. 
It’d been her house.
Ryan goes to the door to let the owners know we’re here and what we’ll be doing. 
I try to see who it is he’s talking to, if it looks like C’s mom or Dad or Brother. Or miraculously C herself.
It is her house. 
It’s not. 
I worked there all day.</quote>
Summary Details: 
<context>The summary extrapolates details that are not clear from this ending:</context>
<quote>He wonders if it could be C's house, which would be an extraordinary coincidence given his thoughts about her. However, <bold>as they start working, it becomes clear that the house is neither C's current residence nor her family's home. The protagonist spends the day working there, surrounded by the normalcy of his job and the company of his crewmates.</bold></quote>

Story Details: 
<context>The narrator gets a ride home with Alex, a classmate who is a known pathological liar, after she has finished an interview for a nuclear internship. She finds a USB in his car that was supposedly used for blackmail.</context>
<quote>Alex told me that the USB stick was filled with malware… There was this rich college kid in Japan whose Facebook account Alex had logged into… Alex emailed him and told him that if he didn't PayPal him $5,000, Alex would… send the photos of genitalia to his mother. Alex said this all slowly, uneasily, and then, when he rounded the end of the sentence, he would smile, indents in his cheeks, as if he couldn't help it. 
"My house is at the end of this street," I said, pointing straight ahead… "I can't tell if you're telling me the truth."
"I don't tell lie in cars. It's too intimate." He stopped the car in my driveway and checked his phone. "Hey," he said, looking up at me, his eyebrows raised. "I got the nuclear internship." 
There was something about Alex-it could've been his thinness-that made me think he would end up dead in a faint. Maybe it was because he was a liar, and I had this naive, irritating tendency to believe that liars never lasted, that the truth always came out. 
"Congratulations," I said, believing him.</quote?
Summary Details: 
<context>The summary simplifies or omits subtext around whether the narrator thinks these statements are truths or lies.</context>
<quote>[The narrator] <bold>is unsure whether to believe Alex's [blackmail story], but he insists</bold> he doesn't lie in cars due to the intimacy of the setting. Upon arrival at [her] house, Alex <bold>casually mentions that he secured the nuclear internship.</bold></quote>

After the study, this excerpt appeared in an essay in the 2023 LARB Quarterly, no. 39: Air issue (and is now their original work, shown with their permission).
<context>The story describes how Mamá, the narrator’s mother,  ended up immigrating to America.</context>
<quote>Mamá came to America because her family had disappeared. Bisabuela, bisabuelo — one day she looked out her bedroom window and they were boarding a ship, waving goodbye to the fog, a sparkling sliver in their place, a dangling dreamcatcher swishing back and forth in the wind. 
Her heart was swallowed too. Her husband took her to the doctors and the doctors lifted her arms and tapped her shoulders and ran a tongue depressor along her legs and breasts and shook their heads. For two weeks they kept her under observation. She lay on tissue paper, coarse gown swishing about her knees as she woke with a start each night to the beeping of her own heart monitor and fell back again into the unyielding mattress. Her husband, not yet Papi, watched on from the guest chair in the corner of the room. When the prodding and swabbing… had ceased,… they pulled my father into the other room and told him: you have to take her to America.</quote>
Summary Details: 
<context>The summary does not suggest mental health/depression in the way that the story does, which is an important part of understanding the family dynamic.</context>
<quote>The story delves into Mamá's past, revealing her immigration to America after her family vanished, a journey prompted <bold>by her own health issues.</bold></quote>

Story Details: 
After the study, this excerpt appeared in an essay in the 2023 LARB Quarterly, no. 39: Air issue (and is now their original work, shown with their permission).
<context>The narrator is reminiscing about their mother and father. Mamá struggled with mental health and then brain cancer, and Papi kept her alive and supported the whole family.</context>
<quote>Mamá bought pearls, bracelets, hair extensions. She put them on her body and on ours… and we smiled when she kissed our cheeks. She showed us the rubies and the sapphires she hid at the back of her closet, how they glittered and glowed on our little fingers as they did on hers. She showed us boa scarves and mascara and gloss for our lips. She rubbed our bellies and we laughed and she laughed as she held us tight against her silky blouse and purred. 
When Papi came home we hid everything. He eyed us suspiciously as he put away the groceries in the dim light of the refrigerator and Mamá wiped her lipstick off with a hand towel, erasing what we couldn’t afford.   
Sometimes I saw her go to the window, late at night, when Papi was working a graveyard shift. I would see her shadow stretch over our little backyard and she would cast her hands up toward the sky, toward the moon and grey clouds in dissipation.</quote>
Summary Details: 
<context>The summary simplifies the character personalities in this description of this vignette.</context>
<quote>The family's dynamic is one of love and secrecy, with Mamá's <bold>vibrant spirit</bold> contrasted against the practicality and <bold>austerity</bold> of Papi.</quote>

Story Details: 
<context>The narrator is trying to receive a package and is frantically checking the tracking, but the package is mistakenly delivered to the neighbors’ house. The narrator doesn’t go ask for it and the neighbor doesn’t return it. The story ends revealing more details about what the package might contain:</context>
<quote>I don’t know what to do next. 
I can’t order another one. Sold out. Expensive. 
No way is this something the neighbor would want or need. 
I’m not saying I’m special or unique. In fact, quite the opposite. This is almost embarrassing. My name was on the address. My address was too. Now they know what I don’t want them to know. No way I’m telling you exactly what it was. I don’t need you to also think I’m sick and twisted.</quote>
Summary Details: 
<context>The summary does not capture the paranoia of the narrator and what is hinted at about the package.</context>
<quote>The item was also of <bold>a personal nature</bold>, something the neighbor would neither want nor need, and the narrator felt a sense of <bold>embarrassment and violation</bold> over the neighbor potentially knowing <bold>something private</bold> due to the incident.</quote>

Story Details: 
<context>The narrator has moved out of the city and is tending their garden in a more peaceful place. The narrator reflects on gardening.</context>
<quote>I admit it is fascinating if not pleasurable to watch and participate in the dramas of my plants. I nurture tomato plants into sacred carnivorous monsters that first outgrow and then smother the gentler lives of flowering sage and thyme… I am unkind to the blue-black eggplant, that solemn bruise of my garden which resembles, vaguely, my father's head… often when I kneel in the mud I inexplicably recall the long-memorized words – Whatever has come to be has already been named – and I am reminded that everything I do in my garden was long pre-determined by my fated childhood of blood and confessing, the one-year anniversary of my abortion; the urgent, sharp motions of women over centuries grinding maize in bowls.</quote>
Summary Details: 
<context>The summary adds specific meaning to the abortion that is not communicated by the narrator.</context>
<quote>The narrator also reveals a personal and painful memory: the one-year anniversary of their abortion. <bold>This event seems to be a significant factor in their decision to leave the city and seek solace in gardening.</bold></quote>

<quote>The narrator meets a new romantic interest.
I met a girl. We've gone on a couple dates now. I think she's just like me. She loves traveling. She's a dual-citizen from Israel. It's pretty cool. She's been in Jerusalem a lot and she told me all about it. It sounds really beautiful.</quote>
Summary Details: 
<context>The summary makes an unfounded guess at what the narrator means by her being just like him.</context>
<quote>The protagonist meets [a girl], a dual-citizen from Israel, with whom he shares a love for travel and <bold>a desire for a simple life.</bold></quote>

Error 13
Story Details: 
<context>The narrator is not a good read of people and does not present a reliable perspective. He recounts some of his experiences with his new love interest:</context>
<quote>At the park, by the river. The leaves are turning orange. Emily is in the water… She is smiling at me. I don't want to get into the water… I didn't bring swim trunks because I didn't want to get in the water. She's telling me Strip, babe, there's nobody here. I think I might be crazy enough to do it. I am going to do it.
She loves to talk about traveling and about the future. I don't care what we talk about… But hearing Emily talk about the kind of life she wants - a family, going on adventures, vacations - it's like I'm talking to a better version of myself. That's what's so crazy about Emily. She thinks of things I'd never think of and when she mentions them I realize it's something I've always sort of thought about about the things I believe in, but then everything makes sense when she says them.</quote>
Summary Details: 
<context>The summary misreads the level of harmony and depth in these interactions.</context>
<quote>Despite these challenges, the protagonist's relationship with Emily <bold>blossoms</bold>. They share <bold>intimate moments</bold> and discuss <bold>their</bold> future <bold>together</bold>.</quote>

Error 14
Story Details: 
<context>The narrator does not have an accurate self-view. One example we learn this through is how his job prep and interview play out over the story.
	In college: </context><quote>All I took in college was business and science. My brothers did all my other work for me, writing, Gen Eds. I had to do 'communication arts' myself because I had to write a speech. It took me five minutes.</quote>
	<context>Applying for a job: </context><quote>Job interview next week at Advanced Magnesium Alloys. There is not a single company I can't save money for. Not a single one. The last company I worked for, it was an internship, and I saved them half a million dollars. It wasn't even supposed to be part of my job. Any company that hires me can be certain that I will work hard for them. I am a hard worker. I will go above and beyond. I believe in the value of work…</quote>
	<context>After the interview: </context><quote>The jerks at the Alloy company straight said I was too inexperienced to work for them.</quote>
Summary Details: 
<context>The summary buys the narrator’s grandiose self-view instead of recognizing that the narrator does not carefully plan anything and has agency in the “harsh realities” he experiences.</context>
<quote>[The story] highlights the complexities of human relationships, the search for identity, and <bold>the harsh realities that can disrupt even the most carefully laid plans.</bold></quote>

Story Details:
<context>The narrator reflects on a period of time spent driving for Uber.</context>
<quote>People puked in my car twice… 
People lifted people out of wheelchairs to put them in the seats…
People sometimes sat in the front, when they were alone, next to me, like we were friends. 
A young couple offered me a hundred dollars to have sex in the back…
People told a lot of stories about their parents and they expected me to have stories about mine. 
People held hands over the middle seat, like they were trying to hide it from me.
People tried to bring their animals into my car…
I learned how to talk to people, what they liked, what to avoid. Food was almost always safe… I learned to let people talk.
It was the most alone I'd ever felt.</quote>
Summary Details:
<context>The summary puts misleading focus on one detail out of a long list and misses the overall emotion.</context>
<quote>He shares anecdotes about his passengers and their stories, which <bold>often revolve around their parents.</bold></quote>

Story Details: 
<context>A crew has been on a long journey with a captain to try to make their fortune. The captain has repeatedly misled the crew and they have had gruesome and harrowing experiences instead of making money. In the end, the captain goes to New York to try to sell some rare butterflies they acquired, and he returns to tell the crew the result.</context>
<quote>…our butterflies were surely worth a great deal, for they were beautiful…
But when he opened his jar for the rich men, he told us, they clucked their tongues. Our butterflies, they had said, were too damaged to be mounted. They would be useful only for research or reconstruction…
Silence descended onto the room. The captain attempted to pass out the pittance he had brought. An honorable man to the end. Some began to yell, knocked the coins from his hands. Accusations were made… One of the hands made a run at the captain and the cook beat him half to death.</quote>
Summary Details: 
<context>The summary misses the ambiguity that the captain may be lying, thus simplifying why the crew gets violent.</context>
<quote>the captain and some men take the butterflies to New York, hoping for a profit. However, <bold>the butterflies are damaged and fetch a low price, leading to violence among the crew.</bold></quote>

<context>The narrator is now dead.</context>
<quote>I crawled into my cave alone, a limestone alcove on the side of the trail, one hundred and fifty meters from the summit. The blizzard stopped.</quote>

<quote>…a 20-year-old woman finds herself grappling with faith and hope… She makes a simple request to God, asking for the sun to shine…
<bold>The setting transitions to a beach</bold> where the woman observes a seagull…</quote>

Error 20
Story Details: 
<context>This story is written in very subtle interactions. The narrator has just married her partner of two years but feels uncertain rather than sure. He finds her on the beach and asks what she’s thinking about. She responds first, and they converse.</context>
<quote>“I’m thinking about what it would be like to be a cloud… I’d be light. So impossibly light…”
“That doesn’t sound very fun…”
…“But I could float off to anywhere in the world. Hitch a ride on any wind, without any notice.”
…“But don't you think it might get lonely sometimes, always in a different place?”
She said nothing and continued to look out. If she was a cloud, he was a rock…</quote>
<context>We then learn their relationship started in a period when the narrator was saying yes to anyone who asked her out and she likely would have turned her husband down otherwise.
The story ends:</context>
<quote>She tilted her head up to see the same clouds hanging over them. The wind had not blown these away to far off places… Sand sticking to them like skin, they walked back to their hotel.</quote>
Summary Details: 
<context>The summary misses the disconnect present in the relationship.</context>
<quote>The story concludes with them leaving the beach, <bold>their connection underscored</bold> by the physical closeness and shared experiences.</quote>
