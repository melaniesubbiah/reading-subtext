The sister decides to have a baby and the narrator is worried about how the added responsibility will affect her sister.</context>
<quote>Let me explain. 
I had it in my head that Lauren having a baby would be the final straw - the thing that would suck the rest of her color from her. 
      Because she was so young and so far away. From the rest of the family. Who could presumably, like, babysit.  
      And her life had taken on that scary ghostly aura. 
      Plus the pills. 
      I was in love with her and afraid. 
      Which is why I, I don't know. Think the conversation ended up so cursed. 
      Understand: I really in my heart believed that if she went through with a pregnancy, she would finally become invisible to me.</quote>

<context>The narrator finds a creepy den that has been built in her basement to house a creature that has been hunting her chickens.</context>
<quote>It was another house… The walls looked like they had been stained with tar, which gathered in clumps against the unfinished wood, trapped in the moment before it dripped down to the floor. The edges were jagged and uneven, and nails jutted out like ornamentation, the wood intent on mutilating itself. In the middle was a wide opening, a black gaping maw…
She heard the crunch of bone, and then a slurping sound…
And then she saw those eyes again, coal black and shining out somehow even against the dark, staring at her from inside the home her husband had built it.</quote>

She made a deal…
If this bird flies away in the next ten seconds, I’ll allow myself another piece of the cake sitting in the fridge…
“What are you thinking?” a voice materialized behind her. The sand had softened his approach and the sudden question would have startled her if she hadn’t heard it everyday for the past two years…

“And look where you are now.”</quote>

I passed the time counting the shards in ice and the breaths of dogs.

That was my main association with him, that smell like gratitude.</quote>
