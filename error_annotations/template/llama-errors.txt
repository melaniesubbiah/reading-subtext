Story Details: 
<context>The narrator describes her relationship with gardening:</context>
<quote>My garden is mostly a series of sloppily-dug beds and mis-matched pots placed haphazardly around my yard: they are like the strewn toys of a child…
I admit it is fascinating if not pleasurable to watch and participate in the dramas of my plants. I nurture tomato plants into sacred carnivorous monsters that first outgrow and then smother the gentler lives of flowering sage and thyme and even the boyish virility of mint…
Or maybe I am wrong and it is that they know us, the plants, our dark-hole desires and remorse. Maybe it is they who keep us alive. Without gentleness, without loving us, even. Like the ground on which we all withstand. Do they give themselves over to teach us necessary lessons? Maybe we keep them around because they teach us about ourselves.</quote>

Story Details: 
<context>The narrator’s mother has always wanted to eat a monkey’s brain.</context>
<quote>Mom had wanted to eat a monkey's brain since before I was born.
I've heard that eating a human brain can make you go crazy. There's a protein in there that the human body can't integrate into itself. It recognizes its own makeup, something like that. And there are subliminal effects, too, no doubt. We know this because some scientists went to Southeast Asia and studied the tribes there. They said the tribes suffered from neurodegeneration because of the brain-eating, but who can say what other factors there were. If they studied my Mom, they'd probably have come to the same conclusion and she hadn't even eaten any brains yet. If anything, that was the problem. Mom was fixated on the thought of it.</quote>
Summary Details: 
<context>The summary makes up a reason why the mom wants to eat a monkey’s brain.</context>

Anyway, they've never gotten to do anything they've wanted to do and it makes me so sad… I know they've always wanted to live in a big city and Mom in particular I know wants to go to museums and stuff and she hates the coffee at Starbucks and so on… but they're never going to move anywhere. Paul spends all the money he makes on guns. Not the worst investment, honestly, but then he spends so much of his time in the basement cleaning them and I think Mom gets lonely… Mom says he's been having trouble sleeping. He's got this snoring thing that wakes him up, sounds like he's getting strangled… She says it's gotten worse.</quote>

Either way, he slammed the door in her face, which caused him to be grounded for another week…
